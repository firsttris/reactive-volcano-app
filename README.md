# Introduction

The Volcano, a product of Storz & Bickel based in Tuttlingen, Germany, is a renowned vaporizer known for its superior quality. The Volcano can be controlled using the Bluetooth Web API. This project showcases how to create a cutting-edge WebApp to control the Volcano via the Web Bluetooth API.

# Motivation

- Use cutting edge technology to build a Volcano App.
- Interestd in reverse engineering Web Bluetooth API with the Volcano. 
- Show how a reactive application is the better choice for Bluetooth communication.
- Showcase a clean intuitive API written in TypeScript.

# Get Started

You can open the WebApp using this Link and connect your Volcano

# Technology Stack

This project utilizes a number of cutting-edge technologies to deliver a high-performance, user-friendly application:

- **[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)**: A declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/)**: Visual primitives for the component age.
- **[Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API)**: An interface that provides the ability to connect and interact with Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals.

# Prerequisites
